# Slot-Finder

This project was developed during a hackathon at RGMCET by BITS INDIA within a 24-hour timeframe.

## Project Description

The Slot-Finder project is aimed at automating the process of monitoring and managing parking spaces. It utilizes computer vision techniques to detect the occupancy status of parking slots and provides real-time information about available and used slots. The project includes a user-friendly dashboard for monitoring and an interactive tool for customizing the parking slot layout.

## Features

- Real-time monitoring of parking space occupancy status
- Display of available slots, used slots, and total slots on the dashboard
- Automated slot detection using computer vision techniques
- Customizable parking slot layout through an interactive GUI
- Efficient utilization of parking space and improved user experience

## Code Files

- `dashboard.html`: HTML template for the project's dashboard user interface
- `main.py`: Flask application for processing parking space data and rendering the dashboard template
- `slot_detector.py`: Implementation of the slot detection algorithm using computer vision techniques
